== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why do I need to sign up at LikeHack.com? =

LikeHack is a social news feed tool that collects all the stories you share and displays them in one place. It filters out all the clutter from your news feed, providing you with a daily digest of the top stories from your social media, picked out by real people. So LikeHack brings you what really matters from your social news feeds each day.

= How does LikeHack know what matters to you? =

* Each day, you like and share things that matter to you
* We find other people who like and share similar things
* We use their new likes to select the most relevant stories from your news and...
* Bingo! You receive hand-picked stories which you would have chosen to read yourself

The LikeHack widget allows you embed stories from your social feeds into your blog to engage your users. It can be set up as a feed to show your shared links, all the links from your other feeds, or the best hand-picked, new stories.

= Why is the widget not showing any links? =

There are two possible reasons:

* LikeHack is not finding any content in your feed (in which case, add more information sources, RSS feeds and social media accounts).
* LikeHack needs more time to fetch and analyze the content from your accounts (it can take up to 1 day).
